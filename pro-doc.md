# Capacity Planning and Scalability Documentation

## 1. Introduction
Effective capacity planning and scalability are critical to maintaining the availability, reliability, and performance of distributed systems, especially under varying loads. This document outlines strategies for managing capacity, scaling infrastructure, and ensuring system health. It focuses on Docker Swarm for container orchestration, alongside best practices for load balancing, resource provisioning, performance testing, and continuous monitoring.

## 2. Auto-Scaling Strategies in Docker Swarm
While Docker Swarm provides a built-in service orchestration solution, native auto-scaling based on real-time resource metrics like CPU and memory is not directly supported. To achieve auto-scaling, DevOps teams typically integrate Docker Swarm with monitoring and automation tools such as **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, and custom scaling scripts.

### 2.1. Manual Scaling in Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm allows manual scaling through the `docker service scale` command. This can be useful for quickly adjusting replicas when anticipating changes in load.

Example:

```bash
docker service scale my_service=5

```

## 2.2. Auto-Scaling with External Tools
To implement automatic scaling, integrate Docker Swarm with monitoring tools like Prometheus and create custom automation workflows.

### Prometheus + Alertmanager
Monitor system metrics such as CPU, memory, and network usage in real time. Prometheus can trigger alerts via Alertmanager, and based on those alerts, an external automation tool or custom script can scale the services accordingly.

### Docker Swarm + Cron Jobs
Automate scaling checks using cron jobs. Periodically evaluate system resource usage (CPU, memory), and when thresholds are breached, scale the services up or down.

#### Example Auto-Scaling Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cpu_usage=$(docker stats --no-stream --format "{{.CPUPerc}}" my_service)
cpu_threshold=80

if [ "$(echo "$cpu_usage > $cpu_threshold" | bc)" -eq 1 ]; then
  docker service scale my_service=$(($(docker service ps my_service -q | wc -l) + 1))
fi
```
## 2.3. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling
- Adding more instances (containers or nodes) to distribute load, ensuring higher availability and fault tolerance.
- Docker Swarm primarily relies on horizontal scaling.

### Vertical Scaling
- Increasing the CPU or memory of individual containers or nodes.
- Docker Swarm typically does not focus on vertical scaling but can support it if necessary.

## 2.4. Best Practices for Scaling

### Automate Scaling
- Integrate Prometheus for real-time monitoring and use Alertmanager to trigger scaling actions dynamically.

### Performance Tuning
- Scale based on the actual performance data, not just predefined thresholds.

### Graceful Scaling
- Ensure that new containers are healthy and operational before removing old ones, preventing service disruption.

# 3. Load Balancing Setup

- Effective load balancing is key to ensuring high availability and reliable performance. Docker Swarm offers basic internal load balancing, while external solutions can offer more control and advanced features.

## 3.1. Internal Load Balancing

- Docker Swarm automatically balances traffic between containers in a service, based on their health and availability. This load balancing mechanism is part of Docker's internal DNS-based service discovery.

Example of service creation with load balancing:
```
docker service create --name my_service --replicas 3 my_image
```
This will deploy my_service with 3 replicas, and Docker Swarm will automatically distribute traffic among them.

## 3.2. External Load Balancers

For advanced traffic management, you can use external load balancers such as HAProxy, NGINX, or Traefik. These tools provide additional routing features, SSL termination, and more detailed traffic control.

Example: Traefik with Docker Swarm
Traefik is a dynamic reverse proxy and load balancer that integrates well with Docker Swarm.
To deploy Traefik with Docker Swarm:
- 1.	Install Traefik: Use Docker Compose to deploy Traefik as a service.
yaml
```
version: "3"

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.5
    command:
      - "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
```
- 2.	Service Configuration with Labels: Label the service to configure dynamic routing based on the hostname.
yaml
```
version: "3"

services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.my_service.rule=Host(`myapp.example.com`)"
```
This setup routes traffic for myapp.example.com to the appropriate container in the my_service service.

# 4. Resource Provisioning Guidelines

Efficient resource provisioning is essential to maintain system performance while avoiding overprovisioning or underprovisioning.

## 4.1. Understanding Resource Requirements
Each service should be profiled to understand its CPU and memory requirements under load. This helps in defining appropriate limits for containers and services.

- CPU: Use tools like docker stats or Prometheus to monitor CPU usage and set appropriate CPU limits.
- Memory: Ensure each container has sufficient memory to avoid crashes due to overcommitment.

## 4.2. Defining Resource Limits in Docker

Use Docker’s --memory and --cpu-shares options to enforce resource limits for containers.
Example:
```
docker service create --name my_service --replicas 3 --limit-cpu 1 --limit-memory 512M my_image
```
-	--limit-cpu: Specifies the CPU limit for the service.
-	--limit-memory: Defines the memory limit for the service.

## 4.3. Optimal Resource Allocation

-	Avoid Over-Provisioning: Minimize idle resources to reduce infrastructure costs.
-	Avoid Under-Provisioning: Ensure sufficient resources to avoid performance degradation or service downtime.
-	Regularly Monitor: Continuously track resource usage and adjust limits based on real-time demand.

## 4.4. Auto-Scaling Resource Allocation

- Integrate resource scaling with monitoring tools to adjust resource limits dynamically, based on usage metrics such as CPU and memory consumption.

# 5. Performance Testing and Benchmarking Results

Testing system performance ensures it can handle high loads and scale effectively. Regular benchmarking and load testing are critical to identify system weaknesses and validate capacity planning.

## 5.1. Tools for Performance Testing

Several tools can be used to simulate load and measure system performance:
-	Apache JMeter: Load testing and performance measurement.
-	Gatling: Performance testing with an emphasis on high concurrency.
-	Locust: Scalable load testing written in Python.

## 5.2. Key Performance Metrics
Monitor and evaluate the following metrics during testing:
-	Response Time: Time to serve a request.
-	Throughput: Requests handled per second.
-	Error Rate: Percentage of failed requests.
-	CPU Usage: Average CPU usage across nodes.
-	Memory Usage: Memory usage per container.

## 5.3. Example Load Testing with Apache JMeter
1.	Create Test Plan: Set up a test plan to simulate load by creating multiple virtual users.
2.	Execute Test: Run the test and measure metrics like response time, throughput, and error rates.
3.	Analyze Results: Use JMeter’s reports to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
4.  Benchmark Example Results
5.  Metric	Value
```
Average Response Time	200ms
Throughput	500 requests/sec
Error Rate	1%
CPU Usage	75%
Memory Usage	512MB per replica
```
## 5.5. Identifying Bottlenecks

Based on test results, address performance bottlenecks:
-	CPU-bound tasks: Scale horizontally or vertically to alleviate strain on CPU.
-	Network bottlenecks: Adjust container placement, optimize network configurations, or scale networking infrastructure.
-	Disk I/O: Ensure proper disk provisioning or switch to SSDs for I/O-bound workloads.

# 6. Conclusion

By following the strategies outlined in this document, your infrastructure can scale effectively and respond to varying demand while maintaining system availability and performance. Docker Swarm’s orchestration capabilities, combined with monitoring and automation tools like Prometheus, Traefik, and JMeter, empower DevOps teams to build resilient, highly available systems. Regular monitoring, performance testing, and fine-tuning are essential to ensure continued success in scaling.
