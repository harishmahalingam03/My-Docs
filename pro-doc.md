# Capacity Planning and Scalability Documentation

## 1. Introduction
Effective capacity planning and scalability are critical to maintaining the availability, reliability, and performance of distributed systems, especially under varying loads. This document outlines strategies for managing capacity, scaling infrastructure, and ensuring system health. It focuses on Docker Swarm for container orchestration, alongside best practices for load balancing, resource provisioning, performance testing, and continuous monitoring.

## 2. Auto-Scaling Strategies in Docker Swarm
While Docker Swarm provides a built-in service orchestration solution, native auto-scaling based on real-time resource metrics like CPU and memory is not directly supported. To achieve auto-scaling, DevOps teams typically integrate Docker Swarm with monitoring and automation tools such as **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, and custom scaling scripts.

### 2.1. Manual Scaling in Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm allows manual scaling through the `docker service scale` command. This can be useful for quickly adjusting replicas when anticipating changes in load.

Example:

```bash
docker service scale my_service=5

```

## 2.2. Auto-Scaling with External Tools
To implement automatic scaling, integrate Docker Swarm with monitoring tools like Prometheus and create custom automation workflows.

### Prometheus + Alertmanager
Monitor system metrics such as CPU, memory, and network usage in real time. Prometheus can trigger alerts via Alertmanager, and based on those alerts, an external automation tool or custom script can scale the services accordingly.

### Docker Swarm + Cron Jobs
Automate scaling checks using cron jobs. Periodically evaluate system resource usage (CPU, memory), and when thresholds are breached, scale the services up or down.

#### Example Auto-Scaling Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cpu_usage=$(docker stats --no-stream --format "{{.CPUPerc}}" my_service)
cpu_threshold=80

if [ "$(echo "$cpu_usage > $cpu_threshold" | bc)" -eq 1 ]; then
  docker service scale my_service=$(($(docker service ps my_service -q | wc -l) + 1))
fi
```
## 2.3. Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling
- Adding more instances (containers or nodes) to distribute load, ensuring higher availability and fault tolerance.
- Docker Swarm primarily relies on horizontal scaling.

### Vertical Scaling
- Increasing the CPU or memory of individual containers or nodes.
- Docker Swarm typically does not focus on vertical scaling but can support it if necessary.

## 2.4. Best Practices for Scaling

### Automate Scaling
- Integrate Prometheus for real-time monitoring and use Alertmanager to trigger scaling actions dynamically.

### Performance Tuning
- Scale based on the actual performance data, not just predefined thresholds.

### Graceful Scaling
- Ensure that new containers are healthy and operational before removing old ones, preventing service disruption.
